Edit the original file and safe as a tab seperated .csv file

note top header rows and bottom footer rows must be deleted before converting.
non-conforming characters need to be removed. In this case, all the rows that have numbers need all commas and dollar signs removed. Also, a weird '-' like character is used instead of null which was also deleted.
Upload the edited .csv file

change directory on client machine to where occupation.csv is
$ hadoop fs -mkdir education
$ hadoop fs -mkdir education
$ hadoop fs -put occupation.csv education
$ pig -x mapred;
